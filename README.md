# Kirby-Lab-Code
Laboratory projects I worked on while doing research in the [Kirby Lab](http://www.kirbyresearch.com/) at Cornell.

## Spot detection GUI
### What it is and what it was used for:

The visualization of macropinosomes in cell culture conditions is based on the ability of cells to internalize extracellular fluid containing fluorescently-tagged 70 kDa high molecular weight dextran, an established marker of macropinocytosis. For this project, dextran was added to the cell media and fluorescent images were taken in conjunction with the cell colony bright field images. The resulting fluorescence images were used to obtain "bright spots" representing the MPC activity of the cell colonies. Different spot detection methods with different parameters were used on the fluorescence images to produce several binary masks representative of the MPC activity. Pairwise comparisons were presented to several participants and they were asked to choose one based on whether the presented method correctly identified spots of many sizes and brightness. The results of these comparisons were then analyzed to find a method of spot detection that could best quantify MPC activity of fluorescent images. To perform the comparisons a MATLAB GUI that overlaid the spot detection masks on a contrast enhanced bright field corresponding image of the spots was created (Displayed below). This GUI was used to present the different masks to the volunteers.

A set of comparison matrices were created for each observer. Statistical tests were performedon the data resulting in a triangle plot where thex-axis is the Just-Objectionable-Differences (JOD).

### How to use:

The GUI prompts the user to first select the base images (e.g. the fluorescence images), then the user needs to select two binary masks of the base images. Once this is selected the GUI will appear with the two masks overlayed.The user then selects what mask best describes the image by the feature they are looking for. Once a selection is made and the user has clicked on his selection, the user can display a bar graph with the frequency in which each masks was selected, by clicking on display result. In addition a variable "Masks_Selected" is stored. This variable is an array that specifies the mask that was selected for each specific image. This variable was then used to performed statistical analysis of each participant.

## Cluster visualization:
### What it is and what it was used for:

To obtain localization patterns from classification of the spots identified as macropinosomes, and get more insight into the complexity of the MPC localization mechanisms un-supervised clustering was performed on the masks generated by the "best" spot detection method identified by the voting GUI. To visualize the different cluster patterns, a MATLAB script that overlays the different identified clusters onto the fluorescence images was created and it is displayed below.

Full analy-sis of the clusters and MPC localization patterns isstill ongoing, there is great potential that this type of analysis will provide us with a more comprehensivemetric for MPC activity.

### Notes:
These cluster visualization scripts use the code from a modified version of "extract_features_from_objects" script written by Jack Hartman from Kirby Lab.
